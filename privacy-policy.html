    </a>

    We only share data with:

    <li>Legal authorities when required by law</li>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your personal data for as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide the services described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h3>Account Deletion</h3>
  <p>
    You can permanently delete your account directly within the app by navigating to:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Profile → Account → Delete Account</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you delete your account using this feature, all personal data associated with your account — including food logs, nutrition records, preferences, and any uploaded media — is permanently deleted from our systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Account deletion takes effect immediately. In some cases, deletion of large data sets may be completed in batch on our servers and finalized within a short period of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deleting your account does <strong>not</strong> automatically cancel any active subscriptions. 
    Subscriptions must be managed or canceled through the platform where they were purchased 
    (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not retain personal data after account deletion except where required by law or for legitimate security, fraud prevention, or compliance purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are unable to access the in-app account deletion feature for any reason, you may request account deletion by contacting us at:
    <br />
    <strong>contact@nutri-thera.com</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Continued Retention</h3>
  <p>
    We may retain non-identifiable, aggregated analytics data for performance monitoring, security, and product improvement purposes.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    KiddiAI is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly 
    collect data from children under 13.

  </ul>
  <p>
    While we take reasonable precautions, no system is completely secure.
